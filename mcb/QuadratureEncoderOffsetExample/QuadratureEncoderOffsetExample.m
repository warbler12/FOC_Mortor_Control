%% Quadrature Encoder Offset Calibration for PMSM
% This example calculates the offset between the |d|-axis of the rotor and
% encoder index pulse position as detected by the quadrature encoder
% sensor. The control algorithm (available in the field-oriented control
% and parameter estimation examples) uses this offset value to compute an
% accurate and precise position of the |d|-axis of rotor. The controller
% needs this position to implement the field-oriented control (FOC)
% correctly in the rotor flux reference frame (d-q reference frame), and
% therefore, run the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) correctly.

%% Generate Code and Deploy Model to Target Hardware
% This section instructs you to generate code and run the motor by using open-loop control.
% 
% The example uses a host and a target model. The host model is a user interface to the controller hardware board.  You can run the host model on the host computer. The prerequisite to use the host model is to deploy the target model to the controller hardware board.
% 
% The host model uses serial communication to command the target model and run the motor in an open-loop configuration. You can use the host model to control the motor rotations and validate the direction of rotation of motor. The *Incorrect motor direction* LED in the host model turns red to indicate that the motor is running in the opposite direction. When the LED turns red, you must reverse the motor phase connections (from ABC to CBA) to change the direction of rotation. The host model displays the calculated offset value.
% 
% *Required Hardware*
%
% This example supports these hardware configurations. You can also use the target model name to open the model for the corresponding hardware configuration, from the MATLAB(R) command prompt.

% * *Active Low*: To use the model with BOOSTXL-3PHGANINV inverter.
% 
% *NOTE:* When using BOOSTXL-3PHGANINV inverter, ensure that proper insulation is available between bottom layer of BOOSTXL-3PHGANINV and the LAUNCHXL board.

% 
% *Generate Code and Run Model on Target Hardware*
% 
% *1.* Complete the hardware connections.
% 
% *2.* Open the target model for the hardware configuration that you want to use. If you want to change the default hardware configuration settings for the target model, see <docid:mcb_gs#mw_3286e9a5-4b65-4b84-9133-a92130b252bc Model Configuration

% * *PWM Frequency [Hz]*
% * *Data type for control algorithm*
% * *Vd Ref in Per Unit voltage*

% *4.* Load a sample program to CPU2 of LAUNCHXL-F28379D, for example,
% program that operates the CPU2 blue LED by using GPIO31 (c28379D_cpu2_blink.slx), to ensure that CPU2 is not mistakenly configured to use the board peripherals intended for CPU1.

% *5.* Click *Build, Deploy & Start* on the *Hardware* tab to deploy the target model to the hardware.
% 
% *6.* Click the <matlab:openExample('mcb/QuadratureEncoderOffsetExample','supportingFile','mcb_pmsm_host_offsetComputation_f28069m.slx') host model> hyperlink in the target model to open the associated host model.

% For details about the serial communication between the host and target
% models, see <docid:mcb_gs#mw_7d703f4b-0b29-4ec7-a42b-0b300f580ccc Communication between Host and Target>.
% 
% You can use the Scope in the host model to monitor the rotor position and offset values.
% 
% *7.* In the host model, open the blocks Host Serial Setup, Host Serial Receive, and Host Serial Transmit, and select a *Port*.
% 
% *8.* Click *Run* on the *Simulation* tab to run the host model. The motor
% runs and calibration begins when you start simulation. After the
% calibration process is complete, simulation ends and the motor stops automatically.
% 
% *9.* See the *Calibration Status* section to know the status of the calibration
% process:
% 
% * The *Calibration in progress* LED turns orange when the motor starts
% running. Notice the rotor position and the variation in the offset value in the
% Scope (the position signal indicates a ramp signal with an amplitude
% between 0 and 1). After the calibration process is complete, the LED turns grey.
% 
% * The *Calibration complete* LED turns green when the calibration process is complete. Then
% the *Calibration Output* field displays the computed offset value.
% 
% * The *Incorrect motor direction* LED turns red if the motor runs in the
% opposite direction. Then the |Calibration Output|
% field displays the value "NaN." Turn
% off the DC power supply (24V) and reverse the motor phase connections
% from ABC to CBA. Repeat steps 5 to 8 and check if the Calibration complete LED is
% green. Verify that the |Calibration Output| field displays the offset
% value.
% 
% *Note*: To immediately stop the motor, click the *Emergency Motor Stop* button.
% 
% This example does not support simulation. The example automatically saves the computed
% offset value in the |PositionOffset| variable available in the base workspace.
% 
% For examples that implement FOC using a quadrature encoder sensor, update the computed quadrature encoder offset value in the |pmsm.PositionOffset| parameter in the model initialization script linked to the example.
